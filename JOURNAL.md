This section documents how generative AI was used to support learning and development of my project.

Prompt 1

Prompt:
Create a simple number guessing game using Golang.

AI Response Summary:
Generated a command-line version of a number guessing game using random number generation and user input scanning.

Evaluation:
This helped me understand Go syntax, loops, conditionals, and random number generation. However, it was limited to terminal interaction.

Prompt 2

Prompt:
Create a frontend for the game using Go web server.

AI Response Summary:
Generated a simple HTTP server using the net/http package and embedded HTML inside the Go file.

Evaluation:
This introduced me to Go web development concepts such as routing, HTTP handlers, and form submission.

Prompt 3

Prompt:
Improve the frontend design to make it more appealing.

AI Response Summary:
Provided styled HTML with CSS including gradients, card layout, and hover effects.

Evaluation:
Improved user experience and visual presentation. Helped me understand how backend and frontend can work together in a single Go file.

Reflection on AI Usage

Using generative AI:

Reduced research time

Helped debug errors like the EOF issue

Clarified syntax and server setup

Improved design faster than manual trial and error

Accelerated learning of a new technology

AI improved productivity by guiding implementation step-by-step and helping troubleshoot mistakes.
